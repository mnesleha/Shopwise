# Scrum & Workflow

## Purpose

This document describes the **development workflow** used in the Shopwise project.

## Process Overview

Shopwise follows a Scrum-inspired, iterative workflow.

The process is intentionally lightweight and adapted
to a single-developer / showcase context.

## Iterations (Sprints)

- Work is organized into time-boxed sprints
- Each sprint has a clear goal
- Scope is fixed once the sprint is started

## Backlog Management

- Product backlog is maintained in Jira
- Stories are refined and estimated before implementation
- Technical and documentation tasks are treated as first-class backlog items

## Development Flow

Typical workflow:

1. Select story from sprint backlog
2. Clarify acceptance criteria
3. Write or update tests
4. Implement functionality
5. Refactor if needed
6. Update documentation
7. Verify via CI

## Review and Retrospective

- Each sprint ends with a review of delivered outcomes
- Retrospectives focus on process improvement, not blame

## Summary

The workflow prioritizes:

- clarity over speed
- quality over output
- continuous improvement
