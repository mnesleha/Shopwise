# ADR-011: XP-flavored Scrum Process

**Status**: Accepted (Process)

**Decision type**: Process

## Context

The project is:

- single-developer
- very fast (1–2 day sprint)
- strongly TDD/refactor-oriented

## Decision

We use XP-flavored Scrum:

- short sprints
- strong emphasis on:
  - TDD
  - refactoring
  - CI
- less formal planning
- backlog serves as orientation, not a rigid plan

## Consequences

**Positive**

- High productivity
- Fast feedback
- The project is alive and adaptive

**Negative**

- Higher mental load
- Need to consciously monitor scope and completion
