# QA in Development

## Purpose

This document describes the **role of Quality Assurance** in the Shopwise project.

## QA as a Development Partner

In Shopwise, QA is not a final verification step.

QA is an active participant in:

- design discussions
- domain modeling
- test strategy definition
- documentation creation

## Responsibilities of QA

QA responsibilities include:

- challenging unclear requirements
- identifying edge cases and risks
- ensuring testability of design decisions
- validating workflows, not just endpoints

## QA and Documentation

QA actively contributes to documentation by:

- ensuring behavior is explicitly described
- identifying undocumented assumptions
- using documentation to reveal test gaps

## QA and Automation

Automation is a shared responsibility.

QA contributes by:

- defining test scenarios
- reviewing test coverage
- ensuring automation aligns with business risk

## Summary

In Shopwise, QA:

- shapes the system, not just verifies it
- bridges development, testing, and documentation
- acts as a quality multiplier for the entire project
